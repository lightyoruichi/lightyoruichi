ok i want to make a website for myself -

i want to show 3 different side of me, it's like yin yang and mixed lol. so (wuxia, hobby, reading, personal links) - personal, (coding, hacking, open source, product growth) - tech/product and finally marketing side, which is, duh.

Got it. You're essentially branding yourself as a 3-class character:

The Monk (personal, inner world)

The Hacker (tech/product, builder side)

The Strategist (marketing/growth, money side)

Here’s a lean, testable blueprint for your site that doesn’t waste your time:

site structure (3-tab split, fast nav)
Homepage = split gate

Hero line: "I'm Harinder. I build, I break, I market. Pick your poison."

3 CTA blocks:
→ Personal / Monk
→ Tech / Hacker
→ Growth / Strategist

Each link lands on a dedicated scroll section or page.

section 1: monk mode
Tone: quiet, aesthetic, story-driven
Content ideas:

Short bio with wuxia/philosophy/anime twist (“A wandering strategist in exile”)

Book list (e.g. Daoist texts, cyberpunk, growth bibles)

Links to your writing / Substack

Gallery: PlayStation tattoo, travel, Chiang Mai shots

Quote block: something from Fringe or Madam Secretary or 三體

Contact button: “Buy me a tea, not a beer.”

section 2: hacker mode
Tone: punchy, technical, raw
Content ideas:

Projects: VibeSniff, Sayang, etc (tight 1-liner + link to GitHub or demo)

Tools you use (code stack, AI stack, API tools)

One-liner: “Code is my side quest. Speedruns only.”

Link to scripts, setups, productivity hacks (n8n, Retool, OpenRouter, etc)

Easter eggs: terminal-style UI, typewriter animation, Konami code?

section 3: strategist mode
Tone: confident, no-BS, results-first
Content ideas:

Case studies or “Growth Sprints” (FormX, Villa List, peptides, etc)

Frameworks: teardown formats, funnel experiments

Quote: something brutal from Sorkin or Moneyball

Lead gen CTA: “Need traffic, traction, or teardown? Let’s talk.”

Public playbooks or experiments (SEO contest, Black Mirror post, etc)

extra
Tech stack: Use something deployable in a weekend: Astro, Next.js, or even Notion + Super for v1

PWA feel: Fast loads, zero clutter, mobile-first

No CV page: Embed work directly in the pages. Let the vibe do the filtering.

what you get from this structure:
Lets people self-select what they want from you

Shows your multidimensionality without confusing positioning

Feels personal but still functional and hireable

You can build MVP in 1–2 days then iterate

If you want, I can:

Sketch a layout wireframe

Draft copy for each section

Help choose a fast site stack based on your hosting/setup style

What’s your preferred platform to build this? (Vercel/Next, Notion, Framer, Webflow, plain HTML?)

how would you do this like if it were you
,tech wise i was m thinking like maybe  fastapi+html+css+json orr fastapi+htmx or fastapi+fasthtml or notion i can publish it on github as public as well
https://franken-ui.dev/docs/2.0/installation or tailwind

If I were building this for myself with your goals (fast, modular, non-bloated, public on GitHub, easy to update), I’d skip Notion and go the FastAPI + HTMX + Tailwind (Franken UI) route.

Here’s why, and exactly how I’d build it:

why this stack works for you
Component	Why it's a good fit
FastAPI	Clean backend logic, simple JSON or HTML rendering, easy GitHub deployment
HTMX	Partial page updates = no full reloads, perfect for tab-switching UX without React
Tailwind + Franken UI	Fast UI buildout, pre-styled components, dev-friendly and themeable
GitHub Pages + Cloudflare Pages	Free deploy with public repo, or serve via Fly.io if you want backend APIs exposed

This combo gives you:

No JS frameworks to manage (no React, Vue bloat)

Can go full static with progressive enhancement

You control the server + rendering logic

Easy to theme, extend, or plug into your other tools later

how I’d build it (execution path)
1. Scaffold
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi[all] jinja2 uvicorn
npm init -y
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
Add Franken UI plugin via docs:
https://franken-ui.dev/docs/2.0/installation

Set up a base HTML layout with Tailwind classes and {% block content %} Jinja templating.

2. Build views with HTMX
Each section (monk, hacker, strategist) is loaded via HTMX partials:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- In home.html -->
<button hx-get="/monk" hx-target="#content">Enter Monk Mode</button>
<div id="content"></div>
In FastAPI:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.get("/monk", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def monk(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("monk.html", {"request": request})
3. Use Franken UI components
Speed up layout and design with:

Tiles: for the landing selection

Tabs or modals: optional, for deeper content without reload

Typography presets for writing section (monk)

Cards or accordions for case studies (strategist)

4. Make it public
Deploy via:

Cloudflare Pages if static

Fly.io if dynamic

Or GitHub + Render/FastAPI backend

bonus: versioned content with JSON
You can separate content into a /data/*.json structure if you want markdown/links/books/etc. dynamically loaded into sections. Example:

python
Copy
Edit
with open("data/books.json") as f:
    books = json.load(f)
Then feed it to the monk template.

tradeoffs
Pros	Cons
Fast dev cycle, full control	Requires some setup (build pipeline, templating)
Cheap/free deploy	No CMS (unless you roll your own JSON/markdown reader)
Clean separation of content & code	Franken UI is Tailwind-only, some styling quirks
HTMX = ultra-snappy transitions	Won’t scale well to dynamic dashboards unless extended

If I were doing this myself under a weekend constraint, I’d do exactly this stack, version 1 public on GitHub, and maybe mirror to Cloudflare Pages + custom domain.

Want me to generate the starter repo and folder structure for you? Or write the main.py + base.html to kick it off?
